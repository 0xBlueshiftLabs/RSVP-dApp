# RSVP DApp

-- work in progress --

Smart contract that allows guests to RSVP for an event by paying a small fee in to the smart contract. Said fee is returned to any guests who attend the event. Any remaining Ether left in the smart contract, a result of guests not attending, is divided up and sent to the guests that did.

Future work will entail incorporating Open Zeppelinâ€™s Safe Math library to prevent the possibility of overflows, and writing tests in Javascript using Truffle, Mocha and Chai, before developing a simple front end using React.
